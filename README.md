## Overview

Ingredients and recipes are fundamental components of the culinary world, 
working together to create a wide array of dishes and flavors. 

Ingredients are the raw materials used in cooking and food preparation while 
Recipes are sets of instructions that outline how to prepare a specific dish.

They detail the ingredients, their quantities, and a step-by-step process to 
create the desired culinary outcome.
